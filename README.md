# A Simple Flask App

This is a sample of a basic Flask TODO app. The items are stored in memory and are lost when the server is restarted, but it should give you a basic idea of how to get started with Flask on Defang. Note that alognside your .py file, include a requirements.txt so that the Dockerfile can install the necessary packages with pip.

### NOTE:

This sample is intended to provide a basic understanding of how to get started with Flask on Defang. **it is not intended for production use**. If you need something production ready, you should use a managed database like Postgres or MySQL.

## Essential Setup Files
1. A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/).
2. A [compose file](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/compose)
